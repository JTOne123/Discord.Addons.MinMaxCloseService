# Discord.Addons.MinMaxCloseService

This service helps you "minimize" and "maximize" your bots mesages.  Useful on very long messages that you might want to make shorter, yet be able to view the full contents later.  Right now some values are hard coded:
1. The auto delete of the bot messages using the service is 5 minutes.
2. the "info" text can only be called once permessage, and deletes after 15 seconds.

If you want to talk about the service contact me @Orcinus#9043 or join my main bot support server https://discord.me/unimate.

I want to let the user have a bit more control over th timeouts and things, so I will be adding a little more functionality over time.
